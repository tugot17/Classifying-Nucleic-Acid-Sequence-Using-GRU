# Classifying-Nucleic-Acid-Sequence-Using-GRU

Tensorflow 2.0 implementation of classification of the genetic code sequence. Genetic code has form of Nucleobases sequence (A C T G). We use GRU cells (Gated Recurrent Units) to classyfie given sequence to one of five classes. 

The obtained results are surprisingly good, thanks to usage of GRU cells it was possible to achive about 100% accuracy on boh validation set and training set.
